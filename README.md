<h1>Internal Security Audit</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

For this project I completed an internal security audit for an immaginary company based in the U.S.</b>

This is based on the first of the five key functions composing the [**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework): _Identify_.</b>

A security audit is a review of the organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.</b>

This project comprises of three documents:</b>

1. [_Controls assessment_](https://github.com/arnius88/InternalAudit/blob/main/1.Controls%20assessment.pdf), where I was able to list the current assets and assess and prioritize the need to implement various administrative, technical and physical controls across the company.
2. [_Compliance checklist_](https://github.com/arnius88/InternalAudit/blob/main/2.Compliance%20checklist.pdf), where I was able to determine the compliance regulations and policies that the company needs to adhere to in order to do business online and outside of the U.S.
3. [_Stakeholder memorandum_](https://github.com/arnius88/InternalAudit/blob/main/3.Stakeholder%20memorandum.pdf), is a final document where I included the scope, goals, findings and final recommendations to be reported to the stakeholder in order to seek approval to boost security.

<h2>Scenario</h2>


>Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.</b> 

>The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).</b> 

>The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department.</b> 

>Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist. </b>
